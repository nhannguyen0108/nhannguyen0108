### WELCOME TO MY PAGE 👋👋👋

My name is Nhan Nguyen. I am currently a master's student in Data Science at the University of Science – VNUHCM.

🎓 I previously studied abroad in Australia at the University of Technology, Sydney, majoring in Accounting and Finance. After graduation, I worked for 3 years at accounting/tax firms, where I developed strong analytical and business problem-solving skills.

🔁 After returning to Vietnam, I discovered a growing passion for Machine Learning (ML), which led me to pursue further studies in this field.

🧠 I am a Data Scientist with a strong passion for researching AI/ML, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) for Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep Learning.

🚀 I am passionate about applying AI/ML to solve real-world problems and drive data-driven innovation and impact.
